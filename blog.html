                    <p>Scope of `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript:

                        1. `var`:
                           - Function-scoped: Variables declared with `var` are accessible throughout the function in which they are defined.
                           - Hoisting: `var` variables are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global context.
                           - Re-declaration: You can re-declare a variable using `var` within the same scope without errors.
                        
                        2. `let`:
                           - Block-scoped: Variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block (e.g., within loops, conditionals) in which they are defined.
                           - Hoisting: `let` variables are hoisted but not initialized, so you can't access them before declaration.
                           - No re-declaration: You cannot re-declare a variable using `let` within the same scope.
                        
                        3. `const`:
                           - Block-scoped: Variables declared with `const` are block-scoped like `let`.
                           - Hoisting: `const` variables are hoisted but not initialized.
                           - Constants: Variables declared with `const` must be assigned a value when declared and cannot be reassigned after assignment.
                        
                        In summary, `var` has function scope, `let` and `const` have block scope, and `const` is used for values that should not change, providing immutability. It's generally recommended to use `let` and `const` over `var` for more predictable and maintainable code.</p>

                    <p>
                        1. `undefined`:
                           - Represents the absence of a value when a variable has not been assigned or as the default value for missing function arguments.
                           - Typically used for uninitialized variables or properties.
                        
                        2. `null`:
                           - Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
                           - Used to indicate that a variable or property should have no value or as a return value to signify the absence of an object or a failed operation.</p>

                    <p>REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a set of principles and constraints for designing and interacting with web services. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, which are typically represented as URLs.

                        In short, REST APIs provide a structured way for different software applications to communicate and exchange data over the internet, following a stateless and standardized approach using HTTP.</p>
